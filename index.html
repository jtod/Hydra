<h1 id="hydra-functional-computer-hardware-description-language">Hydra: functional computer hardware description language</h1>
<p>Hydra is a functional computer hardware description language for specifying the structure and behavior of digital circuits. It supports several levels of abstraction, including logic gates, register transfer level, datapath and control, and processors. There are tools for simulating circuits, generating netlists, and emulating instruction set architectures. It is an embedded domain specific language implemented using Haskell. This is free and open source software released under the GPL-3 license.</p>
<p>This is version 2.4.2. See https://github.com/jtod/Hydra for the latest release.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Before using Hydra, you need some standard software tools. All of the software described here is free and open source, and all of it runs on Windows, Macintosh, and Gnu/Linux.</p>
<h3 id="text-editor">Text editor</h3>
<p>You’ll need to edit text files, both to configure the installation, and also to develop your circuit specification source code. A text editor allows you to write and modify plain text characters. It is quite different from a word processor, which inserts invisible formatting commands.</p>
<p>You can use any text editor you like; the choice is personal preference. There are some text editors aimed at beginners, such as Notepad. There are two standard text editors popular among serious software developers: emacs and vim. It’s also possible to get word processors, such as Word, to edit text, but you have to be careful about saving your document as plain text. A final alternative is to use an integrated development environment. The choice is yours.</p>
<h3 id="shell">Shell</h3>
<p>A shell is a window where you interact with software using text commands. There are many shells; they are largely similar but use different syntax. Bash is available on every platform, and has become a defacto standard. Windows has several shells of its own, including Command Prompt and PowerShell, but you can also use bash on Windows. You can use any shell you like. The following instructions assume either bash or Windows Command Prompt.</p>
<p>Instead of a shell, it’s also possible to use a GUI (graphical user interface), but setting that up is a little more complicated, and the GUI is less powerful than a shell. This section assumes you’re using a shell.</p>
<p>Whatever shell you use, you need to learn some basic commands: how to change the directory, list the files in the directory, etc. Also, you need to set the environment variables so the operating system can find your software.</p>
<p>If you’re using Windows, it’s simplest to use Command Prompt. If you wish to use bash, here is a tutorial on <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/">how to install bash on Windows:</a>. Another approach is to <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">install Cygwin</a>, which provides an entire Linux suite of software on Windows.</p>
<h3 id="ghc-compiler">ghc compiler</h3>
<p>Install Haskell Platform (www.haskell.org). This gives you the ghc compiler, the cabal package system, some standard libraries, and some additional tools. Check that these are installed with these commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.2
$ cabal --version
cabal-install version 3.2.0.0
compiled using version 3.2.0.0 of the Cabal library </code></pre>
<h3 id="hydra">Hydra</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Download Hydra from https://github.com/jtod/Hydra – click Releases and download the most recent version. It isn’t recommended to use the Code link; that will give you the development branch which is not a stable release. The installation file is Hydra-i.j.k.zip (or .tgz), where i.j.k is the version number.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the file somewhere in your user workspace and uppack it: on Linux, tar -xzf Hydra-i.j.k.tgz and on Windows use 7zip or tar.</p></li>
<li><p>Using your shell (bash, or Windows Command Prompt), enter the Hydra directory and issue the following commands. These commands are the same for both bash and Windows Command Prompt. They update the Haskell package database from the Internet, compile the dependencies, and build a documentation web page.</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>cd /path/to/Hydra
cabal update
cabal v1-install
cabal v1-haddock</code></pre>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Test that it’s working. In your shell, go to Hydra/examples/adder and enter:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>ghc -e main Add4Run</code></pre>
<p>This simulates the <strong>Add4.hs</strong> circuit using test data defined in <strong>Add4Run.hs</strong>, and it should produce the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ ghc -e main Add4Run
  x =  5  y =  8  cin = 0    ==&gt;    cout = 0  s = 13
  x =  7  y =  3  cin = 0    ==&gt;    cout = 0  s = 10
  x =  8  y = 12  cin = 0    ==&gt;    cout = 1  s =  4
  x =  8  y =  1  cin = 0    ==&gt;    cout = 0  s =  9
  x = 12  y =  1  cin = 1    ==&gt;    cout = 0  s = 14
  x =  2  y =  3  cin = 1    ==&gt;    cout = 0  s =  6
  x = 15  y = 15  cin = 1    ==&gt;    cout = 1  s = 15
$ </code></pre>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="./docs/userguide/HydraUserGuide.html">User Guide</a> describes how to install and use the system. It contains an introductory tutorial, a number of examples, and discusses techniques for designing circuits. If the link is broken, there is a <a href="docs/userguide/HydraUserGuide.org">plain text version</a>.</p></li>
<li>The <em>Library interface reference</em> specifies the API, including circuit and function types. This can be found in the Hydra/dist-newstyle directory, with a URL similar to the following. The URL should be just one long line, but here it’s broken into pieces:</li>
</ul>
