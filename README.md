# Hydra: functional computer hardware description language

Hydra is a functional computer hardware description language for
specifying the structure and behavior of digital circuits. It supports
several levels of abstraction, including logic gates, register
transfer level, datapath and control, and processors. There are tools
for simulating circuits, generating netlists, and emulating
instruction set architectures. It is an embedded domain specific
language implemented using Haskell.</p>

## Documentation

* The <a href="./doc/userguide/html/index.html">User Guide
  (html)</a> describes how to install and use the system. It
        contains an introductory tutorial, a number of examples, and
        discusses techniques for designing circuits. It explains how
        the system is implemented and how it works.  If the link is
        broken, here is a <a href="./src/docsrc/indexsrc.m4">plain
        text version.

* The <a href="./dist/doc/html/Hydra/index.html">Library
  interface</a> is a reference document that gives precise
        definitions of the circuit and function types.  If the link is
        broken, see the Installation section in the User
        Guide.</p></li>

* <a href="./Hydra.cabal">Hydra.cabal</a> gives metadata
  for the software, including version and date</p></li>
