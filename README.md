# Hydra: functional computer hardware description language

Hydra is a functional computer hardware description language for
specifying the structure and behavior of digital circuits. It supports
several levels of abstraction, including logic gates, register
transfer level, datapath and control, and processors. There are tools
for simulating circuits, generating netlists, and emulating
instruction set architectures. It is an embedded domain specific
language implemented using Haskell.</p>

## Documentation

* The [User Guide](./doc/userguide/html/index.html) describes how to
  install and use the system. It contains an introductory tutorial, a
  number of examples, and discusses techniques for designing
  circuits. It explains how the system is implemented and how it
  works.  If the link is broken, here is a [plain text
  version](./src/docsrc/indexsrc.m4).

* The [Library interface reference](./dist/doc/html/Hydra/index.html)
  is specifies the API, including circuit and function types.  If the
  link is broken, see the Installation section in the User Guide.

* [Hydra.cabal](./Hydra.cabal) defines metadata for the software.
