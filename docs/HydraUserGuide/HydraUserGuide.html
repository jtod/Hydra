<p>
Hydra is a computer hardware description language (CHDL or HDL) that
enables you to design, analyse, and simulate digital circuits.  It
focuses on logic design, not on the physics of electronic components.
It is concerned with how to connect logic gates into a system, but not
with the electronic characteristics of an individual transistor.
Hydra supports synchronous circuits, where a clock keeps all the flip
flops synchronised with each other.
</p>

<p>
This is free and open source software; see README.md and LICENSE.txt
for details.  To use the system you need the ghc compiler suite for
Haskell, which is also free software.  The Installation section
explains how to download, install, and run the system.
</p>

<p>
The language provides facilities that help to design complex circuits
as well as small ones. The notation is concise and readable.  Large
circuits can be described using circuit generators, which remove most
of the repetition in a circuit description without losing any of the
detail.  New circuit generators can be defined: you aren't limited to
the ones provided in the standard libraries.
</p>

<p>
Hydra has a semantic foundation for circuits that supports the use of
equational reasoning.  This is a formal method that can be used to
transform a circuit to make it more efficient according to a cost
model, as well as to prove that an implementation satisfies a
specification.  In some cases, it is possible to start with an
abstract specification of the desired behavior and to derive
mathematically a circuit that implements it.
</p>

<p>
Hydra is not suitable for all circuit design problems.  It assumes
that all the values on wires are digital, rather than continuously
varying analogue voltages, and it requires sequential circuits to be
synchronous, using one global clock.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org546d529">
<p>
To design a circuit, and to do anything useful with it, we need a way
to describe it.  The description can take two forms.  A
<i>specification</i> is a clear statement of what the system is intended to
do, while an <i>implementation</i> shows how the primitive components can
be connected together into a circuit satisfies the specification.  The
specification of an adder says that the output is the sum of the
inputs; the implementation of an adder says that a specific collection
of logic gates are to be connected by wires in a specific way.  An
implementation of hardware is a circuit design.  Both the
specification and implementation need to be clear, complete, and
precise.
</p>

<p>
An implementation (i.e. a circuit design) may take the form of a
<i>diagram</i> or a piece of <i>text</i>.  For digital circuits, a pictorial
specification is called a <i>schematic diagram</i>, while a textual
specification uses a <i>hardware description language</i>.  Both forms can
also be used for software: a textual specification of a software
algorithm uses a programming language, but there are also visual
programming languages that used diagrams to describe software
algorithms.

A schematic diagram is an abstract picture of a circuit.  It shows the
components and how they are connected with wires, but it does not
directly describe the circuit's function.  A schematic diagram implies
some geometric information, such as the relative placement of
components, and this geometry may be used in fabricating the circuit.
</p>

<p>
An alternative approach is to use a computer hardware description
language (CHDL or HDL).  A circuit specification using an HDL is a
text document, so it looks superficially like a computer program, but
it describes hardware rather than software.  Most hardware description
languages are based on existing programming languages intended for
software, and they model circuits using the paradigms of programming.
</p>

<p>
Schematic diagrams and hardware description languages each have their
merits.  A diagram may be easier for a beginner to understand, and
it's more obvious that a schematic diagram describes hardware and
isn't just a computer program.  However, hardware description
languages scale up better to large and complex circuits, and work
better with software tools that can analyse a circuit and simulate it.
</p>

<p>
An algorithm can be realised using either software, hardware, or a
combination of both.  Algorithms may be specified abstractly, without
referring to either hardware or software.  A common misconception is
to think "if it's a picture, then it must be hardware; if it's text it
must be software".  That's doubly wrong: visual programming languages
use pictures to describe software, and hardware description languages
like Hydra use text to describe hardware.

<h3 id="orge6416b9">Modeling circuits as functions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge6416b9">
<p>
Some HDLs are based on imperative programming languages, using the
assignment statement to model a state change in a circuit.  In
contrast, Hydra is based on pure functional programming, and it models
a circuit as a function that takes inputs and produces outputs. This
is natural, because both a circuit and a function act as a black box
that takes some inputs and produces some outputs.  The underlying
model &#x2013; circuits as functions rather than state changes as
assignments &#x2013; is the fundamental difference between Hydra and
imperative HDLs.
</p>

<p>
Hydra is an example of an <i>embedded domain-specific language</i> (DSL or
EDSL).  A domain-specific language is a language intended for one
specific application domain, not for general purpose programming.
Hydra is suitable specifically for expressing algorithms as digital
circuits, but it isn't a general purpose programming language.  It is
implemented by <i>embedding</i> in Haskell, a general purpose functional
language.  This means that Hydra doesn't have a separate compiler;
instead, its implementation consists of a library of Haskell
modules. A circuit specification written in Hydra is compiled by the
Haskell compiler and linked with the Hydra library.  However, it is
best to think of Hydra as a distinct language: designing a circuit is
not the same as writing a program in Haskell, and some Haskell
programs don't correspond to circuits.

<h3 id="org8be087a">A minimal circuit: HelloWorld</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8be087a">
<p>
To run a circuit, two definitions are needed: a circuit specification,
and a simulation driver.  The circuit specification states precisely
the interface to the circuit, what components it contains, and how
they are connected.  The simulation driver describes how to provide
inputs using a readable input format, and how to format the outputs to
make them readable.
</p>

<p>
It's good practice to place the circuit definition and its simulation
driver in separate files.  By convention, the filename of the driver
ends in "Run".  The HelloWorld example is in the directory
examples/HelloWorld and it consists of two files:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>HelloWorld.hs defines a circuit named <code>hello</code>, which takes two input
bits and outputs their logical <i>and</i>.  In other words, the <code>hello</code>
circuit is just an <code>and2</code> logic gate.</li>

<li>HelloWorldRun.hs defines a simulation driver for the circuit.  The
file provides a main program named <code>main</code> which runs the simulation
on test data which is also defined in the file.  In
HelloWorldRun.hs, the test data runs the circuit on all possible
inputs 00, 01, 10, 11.  Since the circuit is really just an and2
gate, the results should be 0, 0, 0, 1.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3a40fec" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3a40fec">The circuit specification</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3a40fec">
<p>
The circuit itself is defined in a module <code>HelloWorld</code>, which is in the
file named <code>HelloWorld.hs</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-hydra" id="org64fd103">-- File: examples/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.hs   (see Hydra/README.md)
-- Defines a simple circuit; see HelloWorldRun to simulate it

module HelloWorld where
import HDL.Hydra.Core.Lib

-- Define a circuit "hello" which takes two input bits and outputs
-- their logical conjunction, using an and2 logic gate

hello :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a   -- the type of the circuit gives its interface
hello x y = and2 x y            -- the implementation uses an and2 logic gate
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A module begins with a <code>module</code> statement that gives its names,
followed by statements that import other modules.  All Hydra modules
must contain <code>import HDL.Hydra.Core.Lib</code>, which defines, among other
things, the <code>and2</code> logic gate.
</p>

<p>
Following the imports, the module may contain any number of circuit
definitions.  The definition of the circuit <code>hello</code> contains two lines
of code: a <i>type declaration</i> which contains the symbol <code>::</code> and a
<i>defining equation</i> which contains the symbol =.
</p>

<p>
A type declaration specifies the name of the circuit and its
interface.  The declaration <code>hello :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code> contains
several parts:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>hello ::</code>  means "<code>hello</code> has type&#x2026;".</li>
<li><code>Bit a =&gt; = means the circuit uses Bit signals, and we will use the
  name =a</code> for the type of a bit signal</li>
<li><code>a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code> says the circuit takes in input of type <code>a</code>, a second
input also of type <code>a</code>, and it outputs a signal of type <code>a</code></li>
<li>There may be any number of inputs, and each is followed by <code>-&gt;</code>.
This means that the number of inputs is the number of <code>-&gt;</code> in the
type.</li>
<li>There must be exactly one output.  The last <code>a</code> in the type is the
type of the output.  Later, we will see how to allow a circuit to
produce several outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The defining equation specifies local names for the circuit's inputs,
and it gives a circuit that produces its output.  The defining
equation for this circuit is <code>hello x y = and2 x y</code>.  This says
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We will use the names <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as local names for the inputs to
the circuit</li>
<li>There is an <code>and2</code> logic gate with inputs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></li>
<li>The output of that logic gate is the output of the circuit</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3a8ffbe">

To test the circuit, we can simulate it with some inputs.  This
requires a <i>simulation driver</i> which is defined in a separate module
in the file HelloWorldRun.hs.  The simulation driver is essentially a
format statement that defines how to format the inputs and outputs, so
you don't have to read and write thousands of 0s and 1s.  For smaller
circuits, we will also include the test data in the simulation driver
module.

<p>
Simulation drivers can be standalone executable modules containing the
test data, as in HelloWorldRun.  In this case, the name of the module
should be <code>Main</code>.  Two import statements are needed: one to import the
standard library, and one to import the circuit.
</p>

<p>
A Main module should define a function <code>main</code> that will run the
simulation.  This defines one or more actions to perform; in this case
there is only one action, which is to execute the simulation driver
(helloRun) on the circuit's inputs (testdata).
</p>

<p>
The test data itself is a list of lists.  The outer list gives the
inputs for each clock cycle.  Each element of the list contains the
inputs for a particular clock cycle: the i'th element gives the
circuit inputs during clock cycle i.  Its general form is:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org99f3d06">
testdata =
  [ inputs for clock cycle 0
  , inputs for clock cycle 1
  , inputs for clock cycle 2
  , inputs for clock cycle 3
  ]
</pre>

<p>
For any clock cycle, there is a list of inputs.  Since the <code>hello</code>
circuit has two inputs, each clock cycle gets a list of two values.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd83e9f9">
testdata :: [[Int]]
testdata =
------------------------------
--   x   y     expected output
------------------------------
  [ [0,  0]   --  0
  , [0,  1]   --  0
  , [1,  0]   --  0
  , [1,  1]   --  1
  ]
</pre>

<p>
The simulation driver itself begins with <b>helloRun input = runAllInput
input output</b>.  See the section on simulation drivers for more
details.  In brief, the purpose of the driver is to convert inputs and
outputs between a readable textual form and the internal signal
representations needed by the circuit.  It contains three sections.
The first section defines the input signals for the circuit (x, y).
The second section defines the output from the circuit (z).  The third
section formats what will be printed, which may include any of the
signals along with label strings.
</p>

<p>
The following commands will run the simulation, using the test data provided:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~</code>
cd examples/HelloWorld
hydra HelloWorldRun
<code>~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The simulation driver provides the test data to the inputs of the
circuit, runs the simulation, gathers the output signals from the
circuit, and  formats the results:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~</code>
$ hydra HelloWorldRun
  x=0  y=0  output z=0
  x=0  y=1  output z=0
  x=1  y=0  output z=0
  x=1  y=1  output z=1
<code>~~</code>
</p>

<p>
An alternative is to use the interactive ghci interpreter, using the
hydrai command.  This is sometimes quicker than using the ghc
compiler, but the primary advantage is that it allows interactive
testing.  You aren't limited to executing <b>main</b>; you can enter
expressions interactively.  Enter :q to quit.

</p>

<p>
A multiplexer is a hardware version of the if-then-else expression,
and is used to perform conditional actions in a circuit.  It takes
three inputs: a control input <b>c</b>, and two data inputs <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that the multiplexer will choose one of the data inputs
(<b>x</b> or <b>y</b>) and output it.  The data input that is not chosen is
simply ignored.  The choice is determined by the value of <b>c</b>.
Informally, the behavior of the multiplexer is:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
mux1 c x y = if c is zero then x else y
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
(Aside: Sometimes it's helpful to describe some signals as <b>control
signals</b> because they affect what the circuit does, and to describe
others as <b>data signals</b> because they carry variable values.  Since
the behavior of the mux1 is controlled by <b>c</b>, this is a control
input.  Since <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are just arbitrary values, these are called
data signals.  But it's important to realise that this terminology &#x2013;
control and data signal &#x2013; is just a way of talking about the signals.
As far as the actual components and wires are concerned, there is no
difference between data and control.)
</p>

<p>
This if-then-else expression is a programming construct, and it
doesn't directly correspond to digital hardware.  The multiplexer can
be implemented with logic gates.
</p>

<p>
To connect a circuit to an input, write the circuit followed by the
input.  Thus <b>inv c</b> says there is an inverter, and its input is
connected to <b>c</b>, and the entire expression <b>inv c</b> denotes the output
signal produced by the inverter.  Similarly, <b>and2 (inv c) a</b> denotes
the output of an and2 gate; its first input is the output of the
inverter and its second input is <b>a</b>.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
mux1 c x y = or2 (and2 (inv c) x) (and2 c y)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
Here is the complete module defining the multiplexer:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
We can run it with a simulation driver that runs the circuit on all
possible inputs, so the outputs form a truth table.  It's good
practice to write the test data with clean indentation, so the inputs
line up in columns, and to include the expected outputs in comments.

A half adder circuit takes two inputs <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, and produces a pair
of outputs, the carry output and the sum output.  The carry is the
logical <b>and</b> of <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, while the sum is their exclusive <b>or</b>.

The module statement gives a name to this module, and the import

A bidirectional shift register
</p>

<p>
Define a shift register that takes an operation code op and data
inputs x, li, ri, and performs an a state change depending on op:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>op=0 &#x2013; no state change</li>
<li>op=1 &#x2013; load input word x</li>
<li>op=2 &#x2013; shift right</li>
<li>op=3 &#x2013; shift left</li>
</ul>

<p>
The circuit uses a building block srb ("shift register block") which
has an internal state to hold the bit in that position in the word.
The inputs to an srb are an input from the left (for shifting to the
right), an input from the right (for shifting to the left), and a bit
input from the word x (for loading a word).  The circuit outputs a
triple: the left and right outputs, and the word giving the current
state of the register.  (Minor point: the left and right outputs
aren't essential, as they also appear as the most and least
significant bits of the word output, but this approach makes it easier
to connect several sr4 circuits together, and it also fits well with
the definition of the more general sr circuit below.)
</p>

<p>
The structure of the 4-bit version comes directly from the data
dependencies.
</p>

<p>
The shift register block uses a dff to hold the state, and it uses a
mux2 to determine the new value of the state.  This is either the old
value, the data bit x from a load, or the input from the left or right
in case of a shift.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6be42bd">
<p>
A data value in a circuit is called a <b>signal</b>.  A signal is carried
by a wire, and it transmits information from one component to another.
In logic design we don't usually care about the physical
characteristics of a wire, although these can be important at the
lower levels of chip design.  Therefore we will usually refer to
signals rather than wires.
</p>

<p>
The information carried by a signal may be represented as an
individual bit or a cluster comprising several bits.  We can also
describe circuits at a higher level, where signals represent integers
or other data types.
</p>

<p>
A bit (binary digit) can have one of two distinct values.  Several
names are commonly used for these values, including 0/1, Low/High,
False/True, and F/T.  In real hardware a bit signal is represented by
a voltage, but the precise voltage value is unimportant at the level
of logic design.  The particular names chosen for the two bit values
are also unimportant, although they can affect the readability of a
table showing the behavior of a circuit.  When Hydra prints out the
values of bit signals, it will normally use 0 and 1, but you can tell
it to use False and True, or any other names you prefer.  One
advantage of 0/1 is that they are consistent with treating a bit as a
binary digit (False/True suggest treating a bit as a Boolean).
Another advantage of 0 and 1 is that they take up only one character
and they look different.  (Try reading a table showing thousands of F
and T characters &#x2013; they can be hard to tell apart!).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3e0ae51" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3e0ae51">Logic gates</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3e0ae51">
<p>
To design a new circuit, you need to take a set of existing circuits
and connect them with signals.  There are several libraries of
existing circuits that you can start with, and you can also define
libraries of your own circuits for further use.  The Hydra libraries
provide as primitives the standard logic gates, summarised in the
following table.
</p>

<p>
The buffer simply produces an output that is the same as the input; it
is the identify function.  The inverter outputs 0 if its input is 1,
and outputs 1 if its input is 0.
</p>

<p>
Many of the logical operations can be performed on any number of
inputs.  For example, there is the logical conjunction (<b>and</b>) of two,
three, or four inputs.  These correspond to distinct logic gates: the
<b>and2</b> gate has two input ports and there is no way to connect three
inputs to it.  Therefore Hydra doesn't have an <b>and</b> gate; it has
distinct <b>and2</b>, <b>and3</b>, <b>and4</b> gates.  This doesn't go on
indefinitely; Hydra does not define the <b>and5</b> gate or the <b>and73</b>
gate!  (A convenient way to <b>and</b> together large number of inputs is
to use <b>andw</b>.)
</p>

</p>

<p>
Most of these logic gates are provided for convenience, but only a few
of them are necessary.  For example, you can replace <b>and3 a b c</b> by
<b>and2 a (and2 b c)</b>.  However, logic gates with several inputs can be
fabricated on chips, they are slightly more efficient, and most
importantly, it's more readable to use <b>and3</b> rather than two <b>and2</b>
gates.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdb0fde7">
<p>
Suppose we have two signals named <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, and want to connect
them to the inputs of an <b>or2</b> gate.  This is done by writing the name
of the component, followed by the names of the input signals:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
or2 x y
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The value of this expression is the output of the <b>or2</b> gate.  Such an
expression is called an <b>application</b> because the component is applied
to its input signals.
</p>

<p>
Each circuit takes a specific number of inputs, and an application
using that circuit must supply the corresponding number of input
signals.  Here are several applications of logic gates, each with the
right number of inputs.

<h3 id="org02d6c49">Anonymous signals</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org02d6c49">
<p>
A signal may be given a name, such as <b>x</b> or <b>y</b>, although this is
optional.  You can also refer to a signal using an application of a
component to its inputs, such as <b>inv x</b>; the output of the inverter
is an anonymous signal as it has no name.
</p>

<p>
An anonymous signal is described by an expression with several tokens.
When you use it as an input to a circuit, this expression must be
enclosed by parentheses, to turn it into a single object.  For
example, suppose we want to connect the first input to an <b>and2</b> gate
to the output of an inverter whose input is <b>x</b>.  The second input to
the <b>and2</b> gate should be <b>y</b>.  Here is the correct way to write it:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
and2 (inv x) y
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
There are two expressions following <b>and2</b>, denoting its two inputs.
The following notation would be wrong:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
and2 inv x y   &#x2013; Wrong!
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
Here, it looks like the <b>and2</b> gate is being given three inputs, and
the first one isn't even a signal.
</p>

<p>
Parentheses are used in Hydra for grouping, just as in mathematics.
You don't need to use parentheses just to specify the arguments to a
function (that is, the inputs to a circuit).  Some programming
languages requires lots of punctuation to indicate function
application:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
nand3 (x, and2 (p,q), z);   &#x2013; Wrong!
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
In Hydra (as in Haskell) you don't need the extra parentheses and
commas, and they will lead to error messages.  Use parentheses only
when they are necessary to get the right grouping:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
nand3 x (and2 p q) z
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
It can be helpful to give both a schematic diagram and a textual
specification for a circuit.  Each form of description provides
insight, and having both together is often worthwhile.  It's important
to check that the two descriptions of the circuit are consistent with
each other.  To do this, check that every box in the diagram
corresponds to a circuit (function) in the text, and check that the
wires in the diagram correspond to the signals in the text.

<h3 id="org14c8d5d">Named signals and equations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org14c8d5d">
<p>
Sometimes it's useful to give a name to a signal, rather than using it
anonymously.  A named signal can be used as an input to several
different components, but an anonymous signal cannot.  Names can also
make it easier to explain the circuit, and well chosen names help
document the purpose of a signal.
</p>

<p>
A signal can be named using an equation.  The left hand side of the
equation is the name, and the right hand side is an expression that
defines the signal.  The following equation says that the output of
the <b>and3</b> gate has the name <b>x</b>.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
x = and3 a (inv b) c
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the choice between anonymous and named signals is just a
matter of style.  Here is a signal defined using three anonymous
signals:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
x = nand2 (xor2 a b) (inv (nor2 c d))
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
This can be rewritten so as to give every signal an explicit name, by
introducing additional equations:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
x = nand2 p q
p = xor2 a b
q = inv r
r = nor2 c d
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
An equation like this is called a <b>defining equation</b>, because the
left hand side has to be a signal name whose value is defined to be
the right hand side.  It would be wrong, for example, to write
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
nand2 p q = x   &#x2013; Wrong!
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
When using <b>equational reasoning</b> you will encounter equations with a
more general form, but in defining signals, the left hand side is
always a signal name.

A constant signal always carries the same value: either it is always
0, or always 1.  The names of these two constants are written as
<b>zero</b> and <b>one</b>.  Names in Hydra always begin with a lower case

circuit specification; those notations have other meanings and will

<p>
A new circuit can be designed by connecting together a number of
existing ones.  The examples given so far consist of logic gates,
which are primitive components.  To design larger scale systems, we
need the ability to define a circuit as a new <b>black box</b> component
and reuse it.  This is similar to using abstraction in a programming
language by defining a function or procedure for a commonly used
computation.  A circuit definition contains up to three parts:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Circuit type (optional)</li>

<li>Interface (mandatory)</li>

The circuit type is covered in a later section.  It's optional,
although it is generally best to include it.  If present, the type can
be recognized by the :: symbol and a number of right arrow symbols; a
typical example is

<h3 id="orgb7b84a3">Interface</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb7b84a3">
<p>
The interface gives the name of the circuit and names its inputs and
outputs.  A circuit is created with a <b>circuit defining equation</b>.
The left hand side of the equation is the name of the circuit followed
by the names of the input signals.  There may be any number of inputs.
The right hand side is an expression giving the value of the output
signal:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
circ<sub>name</sub> input1 input2 = expression
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
This defines a circuit whose name is <b>circ<sub>name</sub></b>, which takes two
inputs named <b>input1</b> and <b>input2</b>, and produces an output with the
specified signal value.  Here is an example:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
mycirc a b c = and3 a (inv b) c
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The input names <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>, are local to the definition of

This part of a definition is optional; if present it follows the
<b>where</b> keyword.
</p>

<p>
The expression that defines the circuit's output can become fairly
complicated, and it's often simpler to define it using several other
named signals.  Each of these needs a defining equation which is
inside the circuit.  To do this, write the keyword <b>where</b> after the
equation, and after the <b>where</b> you can write any number of signal
defining equations.  The general form is:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
circuit<sub>name</sub> input1 input2 = output
  where
    output = &#x2026;
    x = &#x2026; (internal signals&#x2026;)
    y = &#x2026;
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

Here is an example of a circuit named c22 that takes three inputs and
produces one output.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
c22 a b c = x
  where
    x = xor2 p q
    p = and2 a b
    q = or2 b c
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The equations should be indented consistently, and there is no extra
punctuation (no curly braces, no semicolons).  The compiler determines
the structure of a definition from the indentation, not from
punctuation.  Therefore the indentation is essential, and if it's
wrong then the specification will be parsed incorrectly.

The reg1 circuit has a feedback loop: the output of the flip flop is
connected to one of the inputs to the mux1, whose output in turn is
input to the flip flop.  Hydra does not allow feedback loops in pure
combinational logic, but feedback that goes through a flip flop is
fine.  When a circuit contains a feedback loop, there will be a
circular path in the schematic diagram, and there will be circular
equations in its specification.  For the reg1 circuit. the feedback
loop can be seen in the equation which has r on both the left and

<h2 id="orgb76ab2c">Signal and circuit types</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb76ab2c">
<p>
The <b>type</b> of a value determines what operations you can perform on
it.  This holds for hardware description just as for programming.  The
type of a signal determines what kind of information it carries, and
the type of a circuit specifies the types and organisation of its
input and output signals.
</p>

<p>
A circuit has an interface to the outside world, and an internal
organization.  To use the circuit, all we need to know about is the
interface: what inputs need to be provided and what the outputs mean.
The type expresses a useful portion of this information: it describes
the number and organization of the inputs and outputs.  The meanings
of the circuit outputs are not specified by the type; they should be
described in documentation for the circuit.  Since Hydra models a
circuit as a function, a circuit type looks just like a function type.
</p>

<p>
The type declaration for a circuit is optional, as the compiler can
work out the type for itself.  If you omit the type, your circuit will
still run.  However, there are several benefits in writing out the
type explicitly:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The type gives useful information about the interface to the
circuit.  Later on, if you want to use this circuit in a larger one,
you will be more interested in the interface than the internal
components inside the circuit.</li>

<li>There is some redundancy between the type and the defining
equation.  If there is any inconsistency between the two, the
compiler will give a type error message.  That may be annoying, but
at least you know that the error lies somewhere in the (small)
specification of this one circuit.  If you omit the type
declaration, but there is an error in the defining equation, you may
get an error message that says, in effect, ``there is an error
somewhere in the (large) file'', but it's up to you to figure out
<b>where</b> the error is.</li>

<li>If you do get a type error message, the compiler will do its
best to give a helpful and informative message.  In practice,
though, the error messages will be far more understandable if you
include type declarations for your circuits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If present, the type of a circuit should come immediately before the
defining equation.  Type declarations are easily recognizable: they
always contain the symbol <b>::</b>, and usually contain some arrows <b>=&gt;</b>
and <b>-&gt;</b>.  A typical example is
</p>

<p>
<code>~~</code>
reg1 :: CBit a =&gt; a -&gt; a
<code>~~</code>
</p>

<p>
A type declaration contains several parts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The circuit name (e.g. reg1)</li>
<li id="The">symbol, read as "has type"</li>
<li>The signal class ending with =&gt; (e.g. CBit a =&gt;)</li>
<li>The input and output signal types (e.g. a -&gt; a)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfec9e82" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfec9e82">Signal types and classes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfec9e82">
<p>
<b>Short version.</b> If you're writing a routine circuit and just want to
simulate it, you can just write <b>CBit a =&gt;</b> for the signal class
constraint and then use <b>a</b> as the type for every bit signal.  In more
complicated situations, or if you want to know what this means, read
on.
</p>

<p>
When a circuit specification is executed, each signal has a specific
type.  Many types can be used, for example <b>Bool</b> or <b>Stream Lattice</b>.
The choice of type determines what happens during execution.  Some
types lead to combinational simulation, others lead to synchronous
simulation, others perform a path depth analysis, or generate a
netlist.
</p>

<p>
It's possible to define a circuit with a specific type, and if you do
this the class constraint (the part before =&gt;) is omitted.  For
example, we could define a Bool version of the mux1 circuit (call it
halfAddB) to operate in signals of type Bool:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~</code>
halfAddB :: Bool -&gt; Bool -&gt; (Bool,Bool)
halfAddB x y = (and2 x y, xor2 x y)
<code>~~</code>
</p>

<p>
This is a little simpler than the standard definition halfAdd, which
(1) uses the type class constraint Bit a =&gt;, and (2) uses <b>a</b> rather
than <b>Bool</b> as the bit signal type.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb00b244" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb00b244">Combinational signals: Bit a</h3>

<p>
<code>~~</code>
halfAdd :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
halfAdd x y = (and2 x y, xor2 x y)
<code>~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The main disadvantage of using Bool as the signal type is that
combinational simulation is the <b>only</b> thing you can do with the
circuit.  However, Hydra provides many other options.  For example,
you can perform synchronous simulations over many clock cycles, but to
do that, the signals must have a different type.  You can do these
other things with <b>halfAdd</b>, but not with <b>halfAddB</b>.
</p>

<p>
There are several different types that can be used to represent a
signal.  These are organized into two main sets: <b>Bit</b> and <b>CBit</b>.
<b>Bit</b> is used for combinational circuits, and <b>CBit</b> ("clocked bit")
is used for sequential circuits.
</p>

<p>
signal.  The notation <b>Bit a =&gt;</b> means that <b>a</b> can be any type in the
set <b>Bit</b>, and therefore all of the Bit operations can be performed on
a signal of type <b>a</b>.
</p>

<p>
The commonest signal class constraints are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Bit a =&gt;</b> is used when <b>a</b> is a bit signal in a combinational
circuit.  The circuit may contain logic gates, but not flip flops.</li>

<li><b>CBit a =&gt;</b> is used when <b>a</b> is a bit signal in a sequential
circuit, which may contain flip flops and feedback loops as well
as logic gates.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org367e81a">
<p>
After the signal class (i.e. after the <b>=&gt;</b> symbol) come the types of
the inputs and output of the circuit.  In the simplest case, each
input or output signal is just a bit of type <b>a</b>.  There may be any
number of input arguments, and there must be one output result.  A
single arrow <b>-&gt;</b> must follow each input; thus the number of single
arrows in the type is the same as the number of inputs.
</p>

<p>
The inverter has one input of type <b>a</b>, which is followed by <b>-&gt;</b>, and
the type <b>a</b> of the output appears last.  The type declaration can be
read as "inv uses signals in the Bit class; it takes one input and
produces one output":
Thus the entire type declaration ``*inv :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a*'' says
``*inv* is a circuit that takes an input bit signal, and produces an
output bit signal.''
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
inv :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The notation <b>a -&gt; a</b> means "the circuit takes an input signal and
produces an output signal".  This is similar to conventional
mathematical notation; for example in mathematics there is a function
<b>im</b> that is given a complex number (type \(C\)) and returns its
imaginary part (type \(R\)), and a mathematician might write its type as
im : C -&gt; R.  (The reason :: is used in Haskell (and Hydra) is that :
is used for something else.)
</p>

<p>
Circuits that take several inputs have a slightly more complicated
type.  For example, here are the types for the family of and-gates:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
and2 :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
and3 :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
and4 :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
There is always one output, but any number of inputs, and every input
is followed by <b>-&gt;</b>.  To find out how many inputs a circuit takes,
just count the number of times <b>-&gt;</b> appears in its type.
</p>

<p>
If a circuit has several outputs, they must be enclosed in a
container, and this is reflected in the type.  See the section on
Containers.

<h2 id="orgf9e3c8c">Containers</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf9e3c8c">
<p>
In a physical circuit, every wire carries one bit, and doesn't have
any relationship to any other wire (unless it is actually connected to
that other wire).  When we design a circuit, however, it takes several
wires to carry any data value that isn't just a Boolean.  For example,
it takes 16 wires to transmit a 16-bit word, and to the designer there
is definitely a clear relationship among these wires.
</p>

<p>
Circuits may contain large numbers of signals, and it would be
tiresome to name them all.  You can simplify the description of a
circuit by defining <b>containers</b> that hold a collection of signals.
Then you can use the container as a single object, without referring
explicitly to its components.
</p>

<p>
A design is clearer if related signals together are grouped together,
with a name for the entire collection.  For example, we could give the
name <b>x</b> to a 16-bit word, and just use <b>x</b> to refer to all the wires
collectively.
</p>

<p>
Hydra provides two kinds of container: <b>tuples</b> and <b>words</b>.
Tuples are useful for circuits that have multiple inputs and outputs;
an example of a tuple is <b>(x, (a,b))</b>.  Words are appropriate when
several signals are used to represent a number, for example
<b>[x0,x1,x2,x3]</b>.
</p>

<p>
Both kinds of container are written with several elements separated by
commas.  A quick way to tell them apart is that tuples use round
parentheses <b>( &#x2026;  )</b> but words use square brackets <b>[ &#x2026;  ]</b>.
</p>

<p>
Containers are just notations that help to simplify the description of
large circuits.  If you look at the layout of a chip under a
microscope, you won't see any tuples or words&#x2014;just thousands of
individual wires and components.  A circuit specification that names
each one explicitly would be long and unreadable; containers enable us
to write compact and readable descriptions of such large circuits.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0049259" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0049259">Tuples</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0049259">
<p>
Tuples provide the simplest way to give a single name to a bundle of
signals.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we have a couple of signals named <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.  They can be
collected together into a tuple by writing <b>(a,b)</b>.  The elements are
written inside round parentheses ( &#x2026; ) and separated by commas.
</p>

<p>
The elements of the tuple are expressions that describe signals.  Any
expression can be used; it doesn't have to be a signal name.  For
example, the tuple <b>(and2 x y, or2 x y)</b> is a tuple consisting of two
signals, the outputs of two logic gates.  In this example, the actual
signals in the tuple don't have names.
</p>

<p>
A tuple can have any number of elements.  Thus <b>(inv x, y, z)</b> is a
3-tuple and <b>(a,b,c,d)</b> is a 4-tuple.
</p>

<p>
If the basic signal type is <b>a</b>, as usual, then a 2-tuple has type
<b>(a,a)</b>, a 3-tuple has type <b>(a,a,a)</b>, and so on.  The type shows
explicitly the number of elements.
</p>

<p>
One of the commonest ways to use a tuple is to describe a circuit that
has several outputs.  Indeed, there is no way to do this without using
a cluster (a tuple or a word).  Recall that the type of a circuit
contains a number of arrows (<b>-&gt;</b>) and the type of the output comes
after the last arrow.  If there are actually several outputs, we need
to combine them into a cluster and give the cluster's type as the type
of the output.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example.  Suppose we want to define a circuit that has two
input bit signals, called <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>.  The circuit produces two
outputs, <b>and2 x y</b> as well as <b>or2 x y</b>.  Let's name the circuit
<b>aor2</b>.  Here is a full definition:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
aor :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
aor x y = (and2 x y, or2 x y)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The definition of <b>aor</b> consists of two parts: a type declaration (the
line containing <b>::</b>), and a defining equation (thie line containing
the <b>=</b>).  In general, every circuit specification should contain
these two parts.
</p>

<p>
Notice that there are two arrows (<b>-&gt;</b>) in the type.  This means that
there are two inputs, and each has type <b>a</b> &#x2014; that is, each input is
a bit signal.  The type of the output comes after the last arrow, and
it is <b>(a,a)</b>, so the output of the circuit is a tuple containing two
bit signals.
</p>

<p>
The signal defining equations we have considered up to now have had a
signal name on the left hand side: <b>x = &#x2026;</b>.  In general, however,
the left hand side of an equation is a <b>pattern</b>.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to have an input cluster.  The <b>aor</b> circuit above
has two inputs, and these were treated separately: there are two
arrows in the type, one after each input type.  An alternative
notation is to say that the circuit has just one input, which is a
cluster containing two elements:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
aorTup :: Bit a =&gt; (a,a) -&gt; (a,a)
aorTup (x,y) = (and2 x y, or2 x y)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
Compare the definitions of <b>aorTup</b> and <b>aor</b>.  Both of them have two
input bits named <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, but they are organized differently.  In
<b>aor</b>, the inputs are treated as separate arguments, each of type <b>a</b>,
and each followed by an arrow <b>-&gt;</b>.  In <b>aorTup</b>, the input bits are
collected together into the tuple <b>(x,y)</b> which has type <b>(a,a)</b>, and
this tuple is the sole argument.
</p>

<p>
These two circuits, <b>aor</b> and <b>aorTup</b>, are essentially the same.
They would look identical on a VLSI chip under the microscope.  The
only difference between them is the notation used to describe them.
</p>

<p>
There is an asymmetry in the notation.  If a circuit has several
inputs, there is a choice of notation: they can be treated as separate
arguments, or they can be collected together into a tuple.  However,
if a circuit has several outputs, there is no choice: they <b>must</b>
be collected together into a tuple.
</p>

<p>
This notation for types, with the arrows and the (apparently)
different treatment of circuit inputs and outputs, may look strange
and counterintuitive.  There is actually a very good reason the type
notation is designed this way, but it involves some techniques we are
not ready to discuss yet (see the chapter on design patterns).
</p>

<p>
There are other uses for tuples besides just handling circuits with
multiple outputs.  Sometimes tuples are useful just for cutting some
of the boilerplate in a specification, making it shorter and easier to
read.  Suppose we have a circuit where two signals, say <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>,
are needed as inputs to several other building block circuits <b>f1</b>,
<b>f2</b>, and <b>f3</b>.  We could write the specification with all the signals
written out explicitly:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
circ :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
circ x y = z
  where
     p = f1 x y
     q = f2 x y
     r = f3 x y
     z = xor3 p q r
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
But we might be able to simplify this by changing the types of <b>circ</b>,
<b>f1</b>, <b>f2</b>, and <b>f3</b> to collect <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> into a tuple.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
circ :: Bit a =&gt; (a,a) -&gt; a
circ xy = z
  where
     p = f1 xy
     q = f2 xy
     r = f3 xy
     z = xor3 p q r
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
In a large and complicated system, this technique can make a big
difference.  For example, in a processor circuit there may be a number
of signals needed to control the arithmetic-logic unit, and those
signals travel together.  It can cut down on the notation
significantly just to combine them into a tuple, give the tuple a
name, and pass around the whole cluster without mentioning the
individual components.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you may have a cluster, but you need to extract its elements
and give them individual names.  This can be done in a circuit black
box definition using a signal defining equation.  For example, the
following equation defines <b>alpha</b> and <b>beta</b> to be the names of the
elements of a tuple named <b>pair</b>:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
(alpha,beta) = pair
<code>~~~</code>
</p>



<p>
Tuples can be nested.  For example, <b>(p, (x,y,z))</b> is a 2-tuple
(<b>not</b> a 4-tuple!).  The first element is <b>p</b>, and the second
element is a 3-tuple <b>(x,y,z)</b>.  The type is
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
(p, (x,y,z)) :: (a, (a,a,a))
<code>~~~</code>
</p>


<p>
This example shows a crucial property of tuples: their elements may
have different types; in this case the type of the first element is
<b>a</b> and the type of the second element is <b>(a,a,a)</b> and those types
are different, just as a physical wire is not the same thing as a
bundle of three physical wires.
</p>

<p>
Why use a tuple type like <b>(a,(a,a,a))</b> when a simple 4-tuple would
seem simpler?  The reason is that sometimes, in larger systems, a
sub-circuit produces many outputs, and groups of them will then be
connected to different destinations.  The notation to describe this is
simpler if the tuple structure matches the logical organization of the
circuit.  We will see several examples of this, especially in the
design of processors.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to have two different signal representations in a
specification.  Each one needs its own distinct type variable name.
For example, suppose we are designing a circuit that has a basic bit
signal type <b>a</b>, but the circuit also has some values where we aren't
concerned about the bit representation (floating point numbers,
perhaps).  To abstract away from the bit representation, we could give
another type <b>b</b> to these abstract values.  Then a black box circuit
that outputs both a bit and a floating point number would have the
output type <b>(a,b)</b>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6644d54">
<p>
There are two kinds of cluster that allow several signals to be
collected together into one entity.  The previous section discussed
tuples, and now we introduce words.  Tuples allow arbitrary groupings,
while words have a regular structure and their elements can be
accessed by indexing.  Words are frequently used for collections of
bits that represent binary numbers.
</p>


<p>
In a word, bit indices are 0, 1, &#x2026;, n-1 where bit 0 is most
significant.  The expression <b>[x0,x1,x2,x3]</b> denotes a word containing
the individual signals <b>x0</b>, &#x2026;, <b>x3</b>.  The syntax is similar to a
tuple; the difference is that an expression for a word uses square
brackets <b>[ \ ]</b> while a tuple uses round parentheses <b>( \ )</b>.
</p>

<p>
The basic usage of a word is similar to a tuple.  For example, a
circuit could collect several signals into a word and output that.
Here is an alternative definition of the half adder:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
halfAddw :: Bit a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; [a]
halfAddw x y = [c,s]
  where
    c = and2 x y
    s = xor2 x y
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
There two differences between this definition and the one given
earlier.  First the output expression here is <b>[c,s]</b>, so it's a word,
while the output expression given for the original <b>halfAdd</b> is
<b>(c,s)</b>, which is a tuple.  The other difference is quite important:
the output type is <b>[a]</b>, rather than <b>(a,a)</b> for the original
<b>halfAdd</b>.
</p>

<p>
All the elements of a word must have the same type.  If this type is
<b>a</b>, then the word has type <b>[a]</b>.  The type of a word doesn't specify
how many elements the word contains.  This is different from a tuple,
where <b>(a,a)</b> contains exactly two elements, and <b>(a,a,a,a)</b> contains
exactly four elements.
</p>

<p>
Each element of a word has an index, a natural number that gives its
position within the word.  You can think of a word as an array or
vector.  The index of the leftmost position is 0, and the index of the
rightmost position is <b>k-1</b>, where <b>k</b> is the length of the word.
If we have defined some bit signals <b>x0</b>, <b>x1</b>, <b>x2</b>, and <b>x3</b>, then
we could define a word <b>x</b> of these bits with the equation
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
w = [x0,x1,x2,x3]
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
There are actually two conventions commonly used in computer systems.
One convention starts with position 0 at the left end, and counts up
going to the right.  This is called <b>big Endian</b> notation.  The
other convention, naturally called <b>little Endian</b>, starts with 0
as the index of the rightmost element, and the indices count up going
to the left.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
[x0,x1,x2,x3]   &#x2013; Big Endian convention
[x3,x2,x1,x0]   &#x2013; Little Endian convention
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
As you might imagine, neither convention is fundamentally better than
the other, but there are all sorts of minor issues that might cause
one to be preferred over the other.  Hydra allows both conventions,
but in this book we will stick to Big Endian consistently.
</p>

<p>
There seems to be a phenomenon in computer systems, where the less
significant an issue is, the more heated debate there is about it.
This phenomenon was actually the inspiration for the odd names
Big/Little Endian.  The names come from Gullivers Travels, by Jonathan
Swift, where the citizens of the kingdom of Blefuscu open their eggs
at the big end, while the citizens of Lilliput open their eggs at the
little end.  The application of this story to computer systems comes
from an article by Danny Cohen, ``On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peach''
(IEEE Computer, October 1981).
</p>

<p>
The point here (aside from an entertaining digression) is that having
a standard is a good idea, and arguments for one particular choice are
less compelling than having a consistent standard.  Nevertheless,
there is one situation in hardware description where Little Endian is
slightly more convenient than Big Endian (see ref????) and some
authors actually combine both conventions.  The confusion isn't worth
it!
</p>

<p>
The size or length of a word is the number of elements it contains.
If a word contains \(k\) elements, then their indices range from 0 to
\(k-1\).  Hydra provides a meta-function <b>length</b> that takes a word and
returns an integer giving its size.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
length :: [a] -&gt; Int
<code>~~~</code>
</p>


<p>
For example, <b>length [x0,x1,x2] = 3</b>.  With just the parts of Hydra
covered so far, there is no way to use the length of a word, but later
we will encounter some more powerful features where an algorithm will
generate a circuit of a given size, and then the <b>length</b> function
will be useful.  It's important to remember that <b>length</b> is not a
circuit; it is part of the notation used to describe circuits.
</p>

<p>
There are several notations and operators that can be used to build
words from signals, and for extracting the signals within a word.  The
following sections introduce these notations, and then a couple of
example circuits will be presented.

If you have expressions that define some signals, a word comprising
the signals can be constructed by writing the expressions in square
brackets, separated by commas.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
[p,q,r,s]
<code>~~~</code>
</p>


<p>
The length of a word can be any natural number.  Thus <b>[]</b> is the
empty word, <b>[x]</b> is a word containing just one element, and so on.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
[]                          &#x2013; length = 0
[x]                         &#x2013; length = 1
[x,y]                       &#x2013; length = 2
[x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7]   &#x2013; length = 8
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
Suppose you have a word <b>w</b>, of any length, and a bit signal <b>x</b>.
Thus <b>w :: [a]</b> and <b>x :: a</b>, where <b>a</b> is the basic signal type.
Then we can construct a new word which is just like <b>w</b> except that
the singleton <b>x</b> is attached to the front.  The notation for this is
<b>x:w</b>, which is pronounced ``*x cons w*''.  For example, suppose <b>w =
[p,q,r,s]</b>.  Then <b>(x:w) = [x,p,q,r,s]</b>.  The properties of the <b>(:)</b>
operator are summarized as follows:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
x :: a
w :: [a]
(x:w) :: [a]
length (x:w) = 1 + length w
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
It's often useful to take two words that have already been defined,
and to define a bigger one that contains the elements of both.  This
is called <b>append</b> or <b>concatenation</b>, and is done using the
<b>(++)</b> operator.  The word <b>w1 ++ w2</b> is a word containing first the
elements of <b>w1</b>, and then the elements of <b>w2</b>.  Here are some
examples and properties of append:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
[x0,x1,x2,x3] <del>+ [y0,y1] = [x0,x1,x2,x3,y0,y1]

<h4 id="org340b992">Accessing parts of a word</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org340b992">
<p>
Often we can perform operations on entire words, using word-oriented
digital circuits, without ever accessing individual elements of a
word.  Later we will see a family of building block circuits that
operate on words.  Normally this is the best way to organize a circuit
that works with words.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, however, it's necessary to extract one or more elements of
a word.  One way to do this is by <b>indexing</b>.  Each element of a
word <b>w</b> has an index, ranging from 0 to \(k-1\), where <b>k = length w</b>.
The <b>(!!)</b> operator uses an index to extract the element; thus <b>w!!i</b>
gives the $i$th element of the word <b>w</b>.  This is well defined if the
index <b>i</b> is in range: \(i \leq length\ w\).  If \(i<0\), or \(i \geq
length\  W\), then <b>w!!i</b> is an error.
</p>


<p>
<code>~~</code>
w!!i                   i'th bit of word w
field w i j            bits i..i+j-1 of word w
<code>~~</code>
</p>


<p>
There are two special cases for indexing that are supported by
specific operators: you can get the least significant (or most
significant) bit of a word <b>w</b> using <b>lsb w</b> (or <b>msb w</b>).  The least
significant bit <b>lsb w</b> is equivalent to <b>w !! (length w -1)</b>, and the
most significant bit <b>msb w</b> is equivalent to <b>w !! 0</b>.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
w !! i                 (!!) :: [a] -&gt; Int -&gt; a
lsb w                  lsb :: [a] -&gt; a
msb w                  msb :: [a] -&gt; a
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
There are three functions that give a field from a word; that is, the
result is itself a (smaller) word, not just an individual bit.  The
<b>take</b> and <b>drop</b> functions give a sub-word that is at the beginning
or end of a word.  Thus <b>take i w</b> gives a word consisting of the
leftmost \(i\) elements of <b>w</b>, while <b>drop i w</b> gives a word consisting
of all the elements of <b>w</b> <b>except for</b> the leftmost \(i\)
elements.
</p>

<p>
More generally, it is sometimes necessary to extract an arbitrary
field from a word.  A <b>field</b> is a word consisting of any
consecutive set of elements.  A field has type <b>Field</b>, and it
consists of a pair of integers <b>(i,s)</b> where <b>i</b> is the index of the
starting position of the field, and <b>s</b> is its size.  Thus <b>field
(i,s) w = [w!!i, w!!(i+1), &#x2026;, w!!(i+s-1)]</b>.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
type Field = (Int,Int)
take i w                 take :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
drop i w                 drop :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
field f w                field :: Field -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
An example of a circuit that operates on words is the 4-bit word
inverter <b>inv4</b>.  Its input and output are both 4-bit words, and each
output bit is the inversion of the corresponding input bit.  The type
notation for the word is concise, since the types of the individual
bits don't have to be repeated, but on the other hand the type doesn't
express the fact that this circuit works only on 4-bit words.

inv4 [x0,x1,x2,x3] = [inv x0, inv x1, inv x2, inv x3]

</p>

<p>
The circuit specification for <b>inv4</b> is simple enough, but it would be
painful to extend this to much larger sizes, say 64-bit words.  The
chapter on design patterns shows a more elegant approach, but for
small words the style used here is adequate.  The Hydra libraries
provide a collection of straightforward circuit specifications written
in the same style as <b>inv4</b>, and they also provide circuits that are
defined using design patterns and that work for arbitrary word sizes,
no matter how large.

<h3 id="orgd00dcb6">Nested clusters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd00dcb6">
<p>
The cluster types can be nested.  A tuple may contain words (or deeper
tuples), and a word may contain tuples (or deeper words, although that
is unusual).
</p>

<p>
There is a style of circuit design called <b>bit slice
  organization</b>.  The idea is that a building block circuit is defined
for an arbitrary position within a word, and these building blocks can
then be combined.  Bit slice style often results in complex groupings,
with words of tuples, and notwithstanding the relatively complex types
it can result in simple specifications of efficient circuits.  The
essence of bit slice organization is to keep the corresponding bits of
several words together.  Thus two words \(x\) and \(y\) could be
represented as a word of pairs, rather than two separate words:
</p>

<p>
\([(x0,y0), (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3)] :: [(a,a)]\)
</p>

<p>
Collecting a group of signals into a cluster is just a notational
convenience; it doesn't affect the actual circuit.  However, grouping
can simplify the way you <b>describe</b> the circuit, and this is essential
for large and complex circuits.
</p>

<p>
When you are designing a circuit with several input signals, you can
decide whether to treat them as separate arguments (each followed by
an arrow <b>-&gt;</b>) or as a single argument which is a tuple or word.
However, if you are using a circuit that has already been specified,
you need to follow the type used in its specification.
</p>

<p>
When a circuit has several outputs, there is no choice&#x2014;the output
signals must be collected into a tuple or a word.  The reason for this
is that the underlying functional language requires that each function
has one result.  This does not limit our ability to express complex
circuits; it simply means that we need to use tuples or words.
</p>

<p>
Grouping is often helpful just to simplify the notation and to make
specifications more readable.
</p>

<p>
A tuple (x, (a,b)) is used to collect several values which may be
unrelated to each other.  Tuples are used for groups where the
components are unrelated, and indexing doesn't make sense.  The
components may have different types: \((a, (a,a), a)\) A word is used to
collect values that belong to specific bit positions, typically to
form a binary number.  Tuples and words can be combined to form
complex clusters.
</p>

<p>
Example: a 4-Bit ripple carry adder
</p>

<p>
For the multiplexer (the hardware equivalent of an if-then-else)
there is little to gain by grouping the inputs, so we use separate
parameters without grouping: *mux1 c x y = &#x2026; *
</p>

<p>
For the full-adder, which adds three bits, it's convenient to
group the bits \(x\) and \(y\) from the $i$th position in a word together,
and to keep them separate from the carry input bit \(c\).
  *fullAdd (x,y) c = &#x2026; *
</p>

<p>
Don't worry&#x2014;the reasons for these decisions will become clear later,
when we start making advanced uses of these circuits.  It's common to
make some changes to the grouping notation for a circuit after you
start using it extensively!

<p>
A demultiplexer is an important building block circuit which is
related to the multiplexer.  It plays a central role in digital
circuit design, and we will see many applications that require them.
A common application a demultiplexer is to decode binary numbers.  For
example, we will use them later to implement memories (since the
address needs to be decoded), and they are also crucial in a
computer's control unit (where they are used to decode instruction
opcodes).
</p>

<p>
A 1-bit demultiplexer, called <b>demux1</b>, takes a control input <b>c</b> and
a data input <b>x</b>.  It produces two outputs <b>y0</b> and <b>y1</b> &#x2014; so it
provides a good practical example of the use of tuples.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
(y0,y1) = demux1 c x
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The idea of <b>demux1</b> is that we want to send the data input <b>x</b> to one
of the two outputs, and the choice depends on the control input <b>c</b>
&#x2014; thus if <b>c=0</b> then <b>y0=x</b>, but if <b>c=1</b> then <b>y1=x</b>.
But what happens to the output that is <b>not</b> selected by <b>c</b>?
That output has to have a well-defined value too, and we will set it
to the constant 0.  To summarize, the behavior of the <b>demux1</b> is
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
y0 = if c==0 then x else 0
y1 = if c==1 then x else 0
<code>~~~</code>
</p>


<p>
 c   x   y0   y1
&#x2014; &#x2014; -&#x2014; -&#x2014;
 0   0    0    0
 0   1    1    0
 1   0    0    0
 1   1    0    1
</p>

<p>
Here is the same thing but without any leading spaces
</p>

<p>
 c   x   y0   y1
&#x2014; &#x2014; -&#x2014; -&#x2014;
 0   0    0    0
 0   1    1    0
 1   0    0    0
 1   1    0    1
</p>

<p>
Table: Truth table for <b>(y0,y1) = demux1 c x</b>
</p>

<p>
The implementation is straightforward.  From the truth table, you can
see that the <b>y1</b> has the same truth table as the <b>and2</b> gate, and
<b>y0=1</b> if <b>c=0</b> and <b>x=1</b>.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
demux1 :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
demux1 c x = (y0,y1)
  where  y0 = and2 (inv c) x
         y1 = and2 c x
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
It isn't actually necessary to define the names of the outputs; here
is an alternative definition that outputs a tuple of anonymous
signals.  The two circuits are identical; the only difference is in
the way they are described.  One advantage of the first definition is
that it offers the names <b>y0</b> and <b>y1</b> that may be helpful in
discussing how the circuit works, but the definitions yield the same
circuit and the choice between them is a matter of style.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
demux1 :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
demux1 c x = (and2 (inv c) x, and2 c x)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
There are several ways that a larger circuit could incorporate a
<b>demux1</b>.  If the pair <b>(y0,y1)</b> is being connected to the input of
some other circuit <b>circ</b> that takes a pair, then we could simply
write <b>circ (demux1 c x)</b>.  However, if the larger circuit needs
explicit access to <b>y0</b> or <b>y1</b>, then they should be given names using
an equation.
</p>

<p>
A demux2 circuit takes a two-bit control and produces \(2^{2} = 4\)
outputs.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
demux2 :: Bit a =&gt; (a,a) -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a,a,a)
demux2 (c0,c1) x = (y0,y1,y2,y3)
  where  (p,q) = demux1 c0 x
         (y0,y1) = demux1 c1 p
         (y2,y3) = demux1 c1 q

When two bits are added together, the result could be 0, 1, or 2.  Two
bits are needed to represent the result, so a bit adder is an example
of a circuit that needs to output several signals.  The circuit that
does this is called a ``half adder'', and its name is <b>halfAdd</b>.
(Later we will discuss the ``full adder'', which adds three bits.)
The half adder can be specified with a truth table:

<p>
From the table, it is clear that the carry function is just <b>and2</b>,
and the sum function is <b>xor2</b>.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
halfAdd :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
halfAdd x y = (c,s)
  where
    c = and2 x y
    s = xor2 x y
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
If you don't want to give names to the outputs <b>c</b> and <b>s</b>, the
definition can be shortened by putting the expressions for the signals
directly in the output tuple:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
halfAdd :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
halfAdd x y = (and2 x y, xor2 x y)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The choice between these alternative definitions is a matter of style:
both are correct and both describe the same circuit.  The definition
with anonymous signals is shorter, while the definition with named
outputs uses simpler expressions and gives standard names for talking
about the outputs.
</p>

<p>
There is another bit adder circuit that illustrates how inputs can be
handled using either separate arguments or tuples.  This is the <b>full
adder</b>, which adds three bits.  Full adders are needed to add binary
numbers, because we have to add the carry as well as the two data bits
at each position.

<p>
Table: Truth table for fullAdd.  The three input bits x, y, z are
added to produce a two-bit result consisting of a carry c and a sum s.
(Note that the input bits do <b>not</b> represent a 3-bit binary number;
they are simply three separate variables to be added.)
</p>

<p>
Since there are two output signals, it is necessary to combine them in
a tuple, so the type will have the form <b>&#x2026; -&gt; (a,a)</b>.  We have a
choice for handling the three input signals.  They could be treated as
separate arguments:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
(1) fullAdd :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>


<p>
Alternatively, the three inputs could be collected into a tuple:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
(2) fullAdd :: Bit a =&gt; (a,a,a) -&gt; (a,a)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>


<p>
But those are not the only possibilities.  Another approach is to
collect just two of the signals into a tuple, so there would be two
arguments, a tuple and a bit.  This gives two more ways to organize
the inputs:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
(3) fullAdd :: Bit a =&gt; (a,a) -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
(4) fullAdd :: Bit a =&gt; a -&gt; (a,a) -&gt; (a,a)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>


<p>
At this point, there is little reason to prefer one of these types
over another.  Later, however, when design patterns are introduced, it
will turn out that the design of larger circuits can be simplified if
we choose version (3), so that is the type actually used for the half
adder in the Hydra circuit library.
</p>

<p>
Don't worry about making the ``best'' choice for such decisions.  No
one always can make the best choice among the possible alternatives
while designing a large system.  What happens in the real world is
that systems are designed according to experience, judgment, and
taste.  If it turns out later that the design could be made clearer or
more elegant by changing one of these arbitrary choices, then that can
be done when the system is cleaned up.  The Hydra libraries have going
through this process several times.
</p>

<p>
Now we can define the full adder circuit.  For convenience, the
calculation of the carry and sum results will be performed by
auxiliary circuits, <b>bcarry</b> and <b>bsum</b>.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
fullAdd :: Bit a =&gt; (a,a) -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
fullAdd (x,y) c = (bcarry (x,y) c, bsum (x,y) c)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
It isn't necessary to name the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> signals individually.
Notice that the pair <b>(x,y)</b> comes into the circuit, and is then
passed to <b>bcarry</b> and <b>bsum</b>.  The <b>fullAdd</b> circuit itself doesn't
use either <b>x</b> or <b>y</b> directly.  Therefore we could just give a name,
such as <b>xy</b>, to the cluster <b>(x,y)</b>.  This shortens the notation:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
fullAdd :: Bit a =&gt; (a,a) -&gt; a -&gt; (a,a)
fullAdd xy c = (bcarry xy c, bsum xy c)
<code>~~~</code>
</p>


<p>
Note that the signals <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> in the previous definition have the
bit signal type <b>a</b>.  This can be stated as <b>x :: a</b> and <b>y :: a</b>.  In
the simplified definition, the argument <b>xy</b> is a pair of bits, so <b>xy
:: (a,a)</b>.
</p>

<p>
To complete the circuit, we need to implement <b>bcarry</b> and <b>bsum</b>.
There are many ways to do this; the following specifications are
reasonable.  Since <b>bsum</b> and <b>bcarry</b> have the same type, we can
declare those types in one statement.  Read this as ``*bsum* and
<b>bcarry</b> both have type &#x2026;''.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
bsum, bcarry :: Bit a =&gt; (a,a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
bsum (x,y) c = xor3 x y c

A singleton control signal is used to choose between two data words.
If the control is zero the first data word is sent to the output,
otherwise the second data word is sent to the output.  The two input
data words should have the same size, and the output word
automatically has that size as well.  This is a circuit generator that
works for any word size.

We will generally specify large circuits using a circuit generator,
not by drawing every component individually.  There are two kinds of
circuit generator.  Design patterns (higher order functions) are the
focus of this chapter.  Special languages for special kinds of circuit
(e.g. control algorithms) are covered later.
</p>

<p>
Design patterns use circuits as building blocks
</p>

<p>
Design patterns are <b>higher order</b> functions: they take one or
more <b>circuit specifications</b> as parameters.  The pattern defines
how to connect up these given circuits in a regular pattern.  A
pattern definition looks just like an ordinary circuit specification,
except It uses recursion to decompose groups of signals.  It uses
abstract circuits, supplied as parameters, instead of specific
circuits.  Its type may include building block circuits (these
parameters contain an <b>-&gt;</b> in their type) and/or size
parameters (with a type like <b>Int</b>).

<p>
Sometimes you have a circuit (it's arbitrary, so call it \(f\))
 that takes an input (say it has type \(a\)) and produces an output
 (call its type \(b\)).
You need to take a word of signals, and process each one with
 the circuit \(f\).  For example, <b>inv4</b> processes each
 signal with an <b>inv</b>.
The <b>map</b> pattern describes this in general.
</p>


<p>
<code>~~</code>
map :: (a-&gt;b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
<code>~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The first argument to the pattern is a circuit with type
 <b>a-&gt;b</b>
The pattern then generates a circuits, which takes an input
 word of type <b>[a]</b> and produces an output word of type
 <b>[b]</b>.
</p>

<p>
Example of map
</p>

<p>
We can define a word inverter using the pattern that places an
inverter on each input signal, to produce the corresponding output
signals.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~</code>
winv :: Bit a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
winv x = map inv x
<code>~~</code>
</p>

<p>
Technical note: in a defining equation of the form <b>f a b c
  = g c</b>, you can ``factor out'' the rightmost parameter from both
sides, giving a slightly shorter form.
</p>

<p>
<code>~~</code>
winv :: Bit a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
winv = map inv
<code>~~</code>
</p>

<p>
This is attractive because it describes just the pattern.

<p>
A recursion, based on the word structure of the input.
</p>

<p>
The base case is an empty input word <b>[]</b>.  In this
case, the output is also empty.
</p>

<p>
The recursion (or induction) case has an input word
  <b>x:xs</b> consisting of an initial bit <b>x</b> followed by
  the rest of the word, <b>xs</b>.  The circuit introduces a copy
  of the <b>f</b> circuit to process <b>x</b>, and handles the
  rest recursively.
</p>


<p>
The following figure illustrates the structure of map recursion
</p>

<p>
Extending map to multiple inputs
</p>

<p>
The <b>map2</b> pattern is similar to <b>map</b>, but it uses a
circuit that takes two inputs (thus its type is <b>a-&gt;b-&gt;c</b>).
Note that <b>map2</b> is <b>not</b> a bit-slice pattern; it uses
separate words.

There is an input word of type <b>[b]</b>.

The elements of the word are combined using a building block

The time required (the path depth) is linear in the word size.

Efficiency

<p>
The definitions of <b>orw</b> and <b>andw</b> are not

If a large number of signals are being combined, a tree
 structure of logic gates reduces the path depth.  If this
 circuit is on the critical path, that will help.
If the technology supplies 3 or 4 input gates, it would
 likely be faster to use some of those, rather than just the 2
 input gates.
The <b>foldl</b> pattern uses one extra gate to include
 the ``default'' value of zero or one.  This is overhead.

<p>
This inefficiency is not a concern, because
</p>

<p>
There are alternative patterns that generate more efficient
 circuits
A circuit optimiser can generate optimal results
If the circuit isn't on the critical path, it makes no
 difference anyway.

The problem: input two binary numbers, in bit slice form:
 <b>[(x0,y0), (x1,y1), &#x2026;, (xk,yk)]</b>
Output the result of a comparision: <b>(lt,eq,gt)</b>,
 giving the values of \((x<y, x=y, x>y)\).  Exactly one of the three
 output bits must be 1.
Idea: start from left, assuming the numbers are equal so far:
 <b>(0,1,0)</b>.
Move over the columns from left to right, updating the
 results of the comparision using a building block circuit
 <b>cmp1</b>.
Going from left to right, once we have established either \(<\)
 or \(>\), that result will never change.
If the current result is \(=\) and \(x=y\), it's still \(=\).
If the current result is \(=\) but \(x\) and \(y\) are different,
 the new result becomes \(<\) or \(>\).

<p>
An equation in Hydra is a true mathematical equation, not an
assignment statement.  This has several consequences.  One is that the
order of the equations does not matter, and it is not necessary to
define a signal before it is used.  The set of equations above
illustrates this: <b>x</b> is defined using <b>p</b> and <b>q</b>, whose definitions
appear later.  These equations could equally well be written in
reverse order:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
r = nor2 c d
q = inv r
p = xor2 a b
x = nand2 p q
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
The order of the equations makes no difference at all to the circuit;
it's best to put them in whatever order seems to be easiest to
understand.  If a top-down view of the circuit seems natural, then the
first set of equations is suitable, but if a bottom-up view is
clearer, then the second set is better.
</p>

<p>
There is another important consequence of the fact that we are working
with mathematical equations.  We can perform <b>equational
  reasoning</b> to transform a circuit specification into a different
form, with a guarantee that the circuit itself has not been affected.
Suppose that we have an equation <b>x = e</b>.  Equational reasoning means
that if <b>x</b> appears in <b>e'</b>, we can replace it with <b>e</b>; conversely,
if <b>e</b> appears in <b>e'</b> we can replace it with <b>x</b>.  This process is
sometimes called ``substituting equals with equals'', and it is
central in algebraic reasoning.
</p>

<p>
Equational reasoning is one of the central advantages to a functional
hardware description language.  It has many applications: it can be
used to rewrite a circuit to make it more readable; it can be used to
transform a circuit to calculate the same result but do it faster; it
can be used to prove that a circuit is correct according to an
abstract specification.  Equational reasoning can even be used to
derive an implementation from a specification.
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple example of equational reasoning.  Start with the set
of equations discussed above:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
x = nand2 p q
p = xor2 a b
q = inv r
r = nor2 c d
<code>~~~</code>
</p>


<p>
We can calculate the value of <b>x</b> using equational reasoning, in a
sequence of steps:
</p>

<p>
<code>~~~</code>
x = {definition of x}
nand2 p q
  = {substitute value of p}
nand2 (xor2 a b) q
  = {substitute value of q}
nand2 (xor2 a b) (inv r)
  = {substitute value of r}
nand2 (xor2 a b) (inv (nor2 c d))
<code>~~~</code>
</p>

<p>
This calculation may not look very impressive, but later we will see
how equational reasoning can solve some quite challenging problems.

<p>
A signal is the value on a wire, and / this is not a number/.  Numbers
are used to describe the sizes of words.  In a circuit specification:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use zero, one for a constant signal that always has the value False,
True</li>
<li>Use 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &#x2026;, for a word size.  Thus [a,b,c] is a word of
length 3, while [] is a word of length 0 and [a] is a word of
length 1.  [zero, one, zero, one] is a word of length 4 that
represents 5.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Even though you must use zero and one in a circuit specification, the
values of signals are generally specified as 0 or 1 for input data and
for formatted output.  It's easier to read 1100 0101 than to read
[one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, one] in the simulation output.
</p>

<p>
If you do use 0 or 1 as a signal, you'll get an error message
</p>

<p>
Here is the beginning of the error message.  It says that the compiler
is looking at the context <i>CBit a</i> and it's trying to figure out if 0
could be a value of type <i>a</i>, but it can't, so there is an error:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
That's all that you need to look at: once you realise that the
compiler doesn't like 0 to be used as a signal, that's all you need to
know.
</p>

<p>
Here is the full error message.  It gives more detail about where the
error was found, and it gives some <i>incorrect advice:</i> the "possible

numbers as signals</i>.

<p>
To design a circuit, and to do anything useful with it, we need a way
to describe it.  The description must be understandable, and it also
needs to be clear, complete, and precise.  Such a description is
called a \emph{circuit specification}.
</p>

<p>
This chapter introduces circuit specification using Hydra, a
\emph{functional hardware description language} which is used
throughout this book.  The focus is on the basic concepts and
notations.  Later chapters describe features relating to circuit
models and simulation, sequential circuits, design patterns, and more.

<p>
Hydra is implemented using Haskell, a general purpose functional
programming language.  Hydra is a subset of Haskell, augmented with
libraries.  A circuit specification is compiled using the Haskell
compiler, and there is no separate Hydra compiler.  However, it's
better to think of Hydra as a distinct language, and some of the
software tools will give an error message if you try to step outside
of Hydra and write general Haskell code in a circuit specification.
You don't need to know how Hydra is implemented in order to use it,
but Chapter ?? explains how the implementation works.
</p>

<p>
The initial sections in this chapter introduce the basic concepts and
illustrate them with examples.  Toward the end of the chapter there is
a more detailed explanation of some of the syntax rules, but a good
way to get started is to follow the patterns shown in the examples.

<p>
In any system design, it is valuable to make a distinction between a
\emph{specification} and an \emph{implementation}.  This applies both
to software and to hardware.  A specification is a clear statement of
\emph{what} the system is intended to do, while the implementation
shows \emph{how} the primitive operations that are available can
achieve the result.
</p>

<p>
A circuit specification may be abstract, giving just a description of
the intended behavior of the circuit.  Alternatively, it may be
written in a way that describes the structure as well as the function
of the hardware.  In this chapter, we will focus on this lower level
form of specification.
</p>

<p>
A specification may take the form of a diagram or a piece of text.
For digital circuits, a pictorial specification is called a
\emph{schematic diagram} while a textual specification uses a
\emph{hardware description language}.  Both forms can also be used for
software: a textual specification of an algorithm uses a programming
language, but there are also visual programming languages that used
diagrams to describe algorithms.
</p>

<p>
A schematic diagram is an abstract picture of a circuit.  It shows the
components and how they are connected with wires, but it does not
directly describe the circuit's function.  A schematic diagram implies
some geometric information, such as the relative placement of
components, and this geometry may be used in fabricating the circuit.
</p>

<h3 id="org91ae057">Hardware description languages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org91ae057">
<p>
An alternative approach is to use a computer hardware description
language (``CHDL'' or just ``HDL'', for hardware description
language).  A circuit specification using an HDL is a text document,
so it looks superficially like a computer program, but it describes
hardware rather than software.
</p>

<p>
Schematic diagrams and hardware description languages each have their
merits.  A diagram may be easier for a beginner to understand, and it
is more obvious that a schematic describes hardware, and isn't just a
computer program.  However, hardware description languages scale up
better to large and complex circuits, and fit better with software
tools that perform actions using a specification (simulation,
analysis, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Hardware description languages use many of the same concepts that
appear in programming languages.  This is natural, because the purpose
of both hardware and software is to express algorithms, and both
benefit from abstraction, repetition, and similar concepts.  Some
hardware description languages are based on imperative languages.  We
will be using Hydra, which is based on Haskell, a pure functional
language.

<p>
A functional language uses mathematical functions and equations to
present an algorithm.  In contrast, an imperative language is based on
assignment statements that change the state of a variable.
</p>

<p>
A functional hardware description language, such as Hydra, uses a
function to model a circuit.  This is natural, because a circuit and a
function are both a black box that takes some inputs and produces some
outputs.
</p>

<p>
Hydra is a language that allows a digital circuit to be described
precisely.  However, Hydra is not suitable for all circuits: it
assumes that all the values on wires are digital, rather than
continuously varying analogue voltages.  There are other hardware
description languages that can handle analogue circuits, but Hydra
is suitable for describing digital circuits like computers, but not
analogue circuits like radio receivers.
</p>

<p>
It isn't necessary to know how Hydra is implemented in order to use
it, but a brief discussion helps to put the language into context.
Hydra is an example of an \emph{embedded domain-specific language}.  A
domain-specific language is a language intended for one specific
application domain, not for general purpose programming.  Hydra is
suitable specifically for expressing algorithms as digital circuits,
but it isn't a general purpose programming language.  It is
implemented by \emph{embedding} in Haskell, which is a general purpose
functional language.  This means that Hydra doesn't have a separate
compiler; instead, its implementation consists of a library of Haskell
modules. A circuit specification written in Hydra is compiled by the
Haskell compiler and linked with the Hydra library.

<div id="outline-container-orgb64b5c6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb64b5c6">Signals</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb64b5c6">
<p>
A data value in a circuit is called a \emph{signal}.  Signals are
carried between components on wires.  Normally we are not interested
in the physical characteristics of a wire, although these can be
important at the lower levels of chip design, so we will usually refer
to signals rather than wires.  A signal may be a bit, or a cluster
comprising several bits.  We can also describe circuits at a higher
level, where signals represent integers or other data types.
</p>

<p>
A bit can have one of two distinct values.  Several names are commonly
used for these values; the most commonly used are 0/1, Low/High,
False/True, and F/T.  In real hardware a bit signal is represented by
a voltage, but the precise voltage value is unimportant at the level
of logic design.  The particular names chosen for the two bit values
are unimportant, although they can affect the readability of a table
showing the behavior of a circuit.  When Hydra prints out the values
of bit signals, it will normally use 0 and 1, but you can tell it to
use False and True, or any other names you prefer.  The advantage of 0
and 1 is that they take up only one character and they look different
(try reading a table showing thousands of F and T characters&#x2014;they
can be hard to tell apart!).
</p>

<p>
A constant signal is a wire that always carries the same value: either
it is always 0, or always 1.  When writing a circuit specification,
the two constant bit signals are written as |zero| and |one|.  (Do
\emph{not} use 0/1, or T/F, or True/False in a circuit specification;
those notations have other meanings.)

<h3 id="orgb231cfd">Circuits</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb231cfd">
<p>
A circuit is a machine that takes some input signals, performs a
computation, and produces some output signals.  Since the outputs
depend on the inputs, the circuit acts like a mathematical function.
This connection between circuits and functions is discussed in more
depth in the chapter on synchronous circuits.
</p>

<p>
To design a new circuit, you need to take a set of existing circuits
and connect them with wires.  There are several libraries of existing
circuits that you can start with, and you can also define libraries of
your own circuits for further use.  The standard logic gates are
defined as primitives in a library.
</p>

<p>
A signal is specified in Hydra by an expression.  The simplest form of
expression is simply the name of a signal.  For example, suppose we
have signals named |x| and |y|.  Then the following expressions denote
the corresponding signals.  Note that |zero| and |one| are simply the
names of the constant signals.
</p>

<p>
*+BEGIN<sub>SRC</sub> Haskell
zero
one
x
y
*+END<sub>SRC</sub>
</p>

<p>
Another way to define a signal is to write an expression that
introduces a component or circuit.  The value of the expression is the
signal that is the output of the component.  The inputs to the
component, which are also signals, must be written after the name of
the component.  Here is an example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell"><span style="color: #0000ff;">or2</span> x y
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is an expression consisting of the name of a component (|and2|)
followed by the names of the inputs to the component (|x| and |y|).
The entire expression describes the output produced by the |or2| gate.
Such an expression is called an \emph{application} because the
component is applied to its input signals.
</p>

<p>
Each circuit takes a specific number of inputs, and an application
using that circuit must supply the corresponding number of input
signals.  Here are several applications of logic gates, each with the
right number of inputs.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">inv x
and2 a b
xor3 p q r
nor4 a b c d
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The expressions we have seen so far assume that we know the names of
all the input signals.  Since an application denotes a signal, we can
that directly as an input.  Here is an |and2| gate with two inputs:
the first input is connected to the output of an inverter (whose input
is |x|), and the second input is |y|.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">and2 (inv x) y
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The expression that describes the output of the inverter requires
several symbols, the component |inv| and its input |x|.  Such an
expression needs to be enclosed in parentheses; thus |(inv x)| is a
single value.  The following notation would be wrong:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">and2 inv x y   -- Wrong!
</pre>
</div>

<p>
\noindent
The problem is that it looks like the |and2| gate is being given three
inputs, not two, and the first one isn't even a signal.
</p>

<p>
Parentheses are used in Hydra for grouping, just as in mathematics.
You don't need to use parentheses just to specify the arguments to a
function (that is, the inputs to a circuit).  Some programming
languages requires lots of punctuation to indicate function
application:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">nand3 (x, and2 (p,q), z)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In Hydra (as in Haskell) you don't need the extra parentheses and
commas; just use parentheses when they are necessary to get the right
grouping:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">nand3 x (and2 p q) z
</pre>
</div>

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figures/xfig/andor.eps}
\end{center}

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">x = or2 (and2 a b) c
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here we need the parentheses to indicate that \textit{and2 a b}
denotes a single value (a signal).
</p>

<p>
It can be helpful to give both a schematic diagram and a textual
specification for a circuit.  Each form of description provides
insight, and having both together is often worthwhile. But it is
important to check that the two descriptions of the circuit are
consistent with each other.  To do this, check that every box in the
diagram corresponds to a circuit (function) in the text, and check
that the wires in the diagram correspond to the signals in the text.
</p>

<p>
A useful skill is the ability to convert from a schematic to Hydra, or
vice versa.  The following problems give some practice with this.
</p>

\begin{exercise}
Draw a schematic diagram corresponding to the following Hydra
specifications:
\begin{enumerate}
\item inv (and2 a b)
\item xor2 (nand3 p q r) (or2 x y)
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
An easy one, no?
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Write a Hydra specification corresponding to the following schematic
diagrams:
\begin{enumerate}
\item foo
\item bar
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
Hmmm
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

<h3 id="org25e7b75">Equations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org25e7b75">
<p>
So far, we have seen expressions that define a new signal as the
output of a component.  But the output signal has no name: it is
anonymous.  An equation can be used to give it a name.  The left hand
side of an equation is the name to be attached to the signal, and the
right hand side is an expression that defines the value of the signal.
The following equation says that the output of the |and3| gate has the
name |x|.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">x = and3 a (inv b) c
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The corresponding schematic diagram is:
</p>

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figures/xfig/inv-and3.eps}
\end{center}

<p>
Signals may be named by an equation, or they may be anonymous.  It is
always possible to name all the signals, if you want to.  This circuit
contains several anonymous signals:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">x = nand2 (xor2 a b) (inv (nor2 c d))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This can be rewritten so as to give every signal an explicit name, by
introducing additional equations:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">x = nand2 p q
p = xor2 a b
q = inv r
r = nor2 c d
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Sometimes an equation like this is called a \emph{defining equation},
because the left hand side has to be a signal name whose value is
defined to be the right hand side.  It would be wrong, for example, to
write
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">nand2 p q = x   -- Wrong!
</pre>
</div>

<p>
\subsection{Equational reasoning}
</p>

<p>
An equation in Hydra is a true mathematical equation, not an
assignment statement.  This has several consequences.  One is that the
order of the equations does not matter, and it is not necessary to
define a signal before it is used.  The set of equations above
illustrates this: |x| is defined using |p| and |q|, whose definitions
appear later.  These equations could equally well be written in
reverse order:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">r = nor2 c d
q = inv r
p = xor2 a b
x = nand2 p q
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The order of the equations makes no difference at all to the circuit;
it's best to put them in whatever order seems to be easiest to
understand.  If a top-down view of the circuit seems natural, then the
first set of equations is suitable, but if a bottom-up view is
clearer, then the second set is better.
</p>

<p>
There is another important consequence of the fact that we are working
with mathematical equations.  We can perform \emph{equational
  reasoning} to transform a circuit specification into a different
form, with a guarantee that the circuit itself has not been affected.
Suppose that we have an equation |x = e|.  Equational reasoning means
that if |x| appears in |e'|, we can replace it with |e|; conversely,
if |e| appears in |e'| we can replace it with |x|.  This process is
sometimes called ``substituting equals with equals'', and it is
central in algebraic reasoning.
</p>

<p>
Equational reasoning is one of the central advantages to a functional
hardware description language.  It has many applications: it can be
used to rewrite a circuit to make it more readable; it can be used to
transform a circuit to calculate the same result but do it faster; it
can be used to prove that a circuit is correct according to an
abstract specification.  Equational reasoning can even be used to
derive an implementation from a specification.
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple example of equational reasoning.  Start with the set
of equations discussed above:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">x = nand2 p q
p = xor2 a b
q = inv r
r = nor2 c d
</pre>
</div>

<p>
\noindent
We can calculate the value of |x| using equational reasoning, in a
sequence of steps:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Haskell">x = {definition of x}
nand2 p q
  = {substitute value of p}
nand2 (xor2 a b) q
  = {substitute value of q}
nand2 (xor2 a b) (inv r)
  = {substitute value of r}
nand2 (xor2 a b) (inv (nor2 c d))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
\noindent
This calculation may not look very impressive, but later we will see
how equational reasoning can solve some quite challenging problems.

\section{General Boolean functions}
</p>

<p>
Suppose a Boolean function has \(k\) inputs, and one output.
</p>

\begin{itemize}

\item Then there are $2^k$ lines in its truth table, and for every
line the output value could be either 0 or 1.

\item Therefore there are $2^{(2^k)}$ Boolean functions of $k$ inputs.

\end{itemize}

<p>
For small \(k\), we can enumerate all of these functions.
</p>

<p>
\subsection{0 inputs}

With 0 inputs, there are \(2^0=1\) lines in the truth table, and \(2^1=2\)

A 0-argument function is just a constant!  These really are truth
tables, although they are degenerate&#x2014;compare them with the following

Use \textit{zero} and \textit{one} as the
two constants.
</p>

<p>
\subsection{1 input}
</p>

<p>
With 1 input \(x\), there are \(2^1=2\) lines in each truth table, and
\(2^2=4\) functions (distinct truth tables).
</p>

<p>
\vspace{1cm}

\begin{center}
\hbox{
\begin{tabular}{||c||c||}

Here \(f_1\) is \textit{buf}, and \(f_2\) is \textit{inv}.  The others
aren't particularly useful.

\subsection{2 inputs}
</p>

<p>
With 2 inputs, there are \(2^2=4\) lines in the truth table, and
\(2^{(2^2)}=16\) distinct truth tables (functions).

All 16 possible functions can be enumerated in a table (each column
specifies a distinct function):
