-- Combinational shifting

-- Shift a word to the right (shr) or to the left (shl).  In both
-- cases, this is just a wiring pattern.  A 0 is brought in on one
-- side, and the bit on the other side is just thrown away.

-- Bit addition

-- A half adder adds two bits x and y, and produces a 2-bit result
-- (carry,sum).  The value of x+y can be any of 0, 1, or 2, and this
-- is the binary value of the 2-bit result.

halfAdd :: Bit a => a -> a -> (a,a)
halfAdd x y = (and2 x y, xor2 x y)

-- A full adder adds three bits x, y, and c, and produces a 2-bit
-- result (carry,sum).  This is a building block for circuits that add
-- words, where a carry input c must be added to the x and y bits.
-- The value of x+y+c can be any of 0, 1, 2, or 3, and this is the
-- binary value of the 2-bit result.  It is convenient to group the x
-- and y bits into a pair, and to treat the carry input c as a
-- separate input; this makes it easier to use fullAdd with the mscanr
-- combinator.

fullAdd :: Bit a => (a,a) -> a -> (a,a)
fullAdd (x,y) c = (bcarry (x,y) c, bsum (x,y) c)

-- The carry and sum results from adding x+y+c are calculated by bsum
-- and bcarry.  For most purposes it would be more concise just to
-- define the fullAdd circuit directly, but for fast adders it is
-- helpful to organize the full adder using separate bcarry and bsum
-- subcircuits.  The bit sum is a parity calculation, while the carry
-- is a majority.

bsum, bcarry :: Bit a => (a,a) -> a -> a
bsum (x,y) c = xor3 x y c
bcarry (x,y) c = or3 (and2 x y) (and2 x c) (and2 y c)
